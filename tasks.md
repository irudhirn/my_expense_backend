That sounds like a great project! To really challenge yourself and sharpen your backend and database skills, you'll want to tackle tasks that involve complex logic, optimisation, security, and scalable architecture. Here’s a list of tough tasks to push your abilities:

### *Backend Challenges (ExpressJS / NodeJS)*

1. *JWT Authentication with Refresh Tokens* 🟨

   * Implement JWT authentication and manage refresh tokens for secure user login. Handle token expiration, refresh logic, and revoke tokens when necessary.
   * Focus on security—store tokens securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies) and implement logic to prevent token misuse.

2. *User Role Management & Access Control* 🟨

   * Build a system for different user roles (admin, user, etc.) and restrict access based on roles. You can even implement granular permissions for individual actions (read/write access for each resource).

3. *Payment Gateway Integration* 🟧

   * Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe, PayPal, or RazorPay for expense-related transactions. This will involve server-side API calls, handling success and failure responses, and storing transaction data in the database.

4. *Rate Limiting / Throttling* 🟨

   * Implement rate limiting (e.g., using express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse of your API endpoints. This is especially important for public APIs like your expense tracking app’s login, registration, and payment endpoints.

5. *Real-time Notifications (WebSockets)* 🟧

   * Use WebSockets (e.g., socket.io) to push real-time notifications when certain events occur—like when a user reaches a budget limit or receives a transaction alert.

6. *Background Jobs / Queues* 🟧

   * Implement background tasks (e.g., using libraries like Bull or Agenda) to handle time-consuming operations like email sending, report generation, or periodic data aggregation (e.g., monthly spending summary).

7. *API Versioning & Documentation* 🟨

   * Build a versioning system for your API to ensure backward compatibility as the app evolves. Also, document your API using tools like Swagger or Postman.

8. *Data Caching with Redis* 🟧

   * Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance. You could cache user profiles, recent transactions, or common queries to reduce the load on your MongoDB.

### *Database Challenges (MongoDB)*

1. *Data Aggregation and Reports* 🟨

   * Build complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines to generate insightful financial reports—e.g., monthly expenses, category-wise spending, budget analysis, etc.
   * Use MongoDB’s aggregation framework to group, filter, sort, and perform calculations.

2. *Transaction Support & Consistency* 🟨

   * Implement database transactions using MongoDB’s session support to ensure consistency during operations like updating multiple collections (e.g., updating user data and transaction records atomically).

3. *Data Modelling with Embedded Documents* 🟨

   * Design an efficient schema for expense tracking that minimises redundant data but allows for fast querying. Use embedded documents (e.g., user’s expenses inside a user document) vs. references (storing IDs).
   * Optimise your schema for queries like filtering expenses by category, user, and time period.

4. *Database Indexing & Optimisation* 🟨

   * Create complex indexes to speed up queries. For instance, create compound indexes to support frequent queries, such as querying expenses by category, user, and date.
   * Learn about index strategies, like TTL (Time-to-Live) for automatic expiration of old data (e.g., for deleting expired transactions).

5. *Full-Text Search Integration* 🟨

   * Implement full-text search on expense descriptions and comments. Use MongoDB’s full-text search features (e.g., $text index) or integrate a more advanced solution like ElasticSearch.

6. *Data Sharding & Horizontal Scaling* 🟧

   * Learn about sharding and how to scale MongoDB horizontally to handle large volumes of data across multiple servers. This will help you design a system that can scale as your app grows.

7. *Data Validation and Sanitation* 🟨

   * Build a robust validation system for data inputs (e.g., user input validation for transactions and expenses). Implement this with custom validation rules and enforce them through Mongoose schemas.
   * Sanitise inputs to prevent SQL injection (or NoSQL injection in this case) and XSS attacks.

### *Advanced Architectures / System Design*

1. *Micro-services Architecture (Optional for Scaling)* 🟧

   * Break your monolithic app into micro-services. For example, have separate services for user authentication, transaction processing, and reporting.
   * Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes to containerise and orchestrate the micro-services.

2. *Serverless Architecture (Optional)* 🟧

   * Explore building server-less functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions) for specific actions, like generating financial reports or sending notifications.

3. *Event-Driven Architecture* 🟧

   * Use an event-driven architecture (with libraries like EventEmitter, Kafka, or RabbitMQ) to decouple different parts of your application and improve scalability.
   * Example: When a user adds an expense, trigger an event to update the monthly budget or send a notification.

4. *CI/CD Pipeline* 🟨

   * Build a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate tests, linting, and deployments using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

5. *Scaling Database with Replication and Failover* 🟧

   * Learn about MongoDB’s replication and failover mechanism (Replica Sets). Set up a replica set for high availability and to distribute read/write operations across multiple nodes.

---

### Bonus Challenges

1. *Multi-Currency Support* 🟥

   * Add multi-currency support to your app, ensuring transactions are handled in different currencies and can be converted with real-time exchange rates.

2. *Data Anonymisation / Pseudonymisation* 🟧

   * Implement a mechanism to anonymise or pseudonymise sensitive user data (like expense data) to ensure user privacy, especially if the app handles personal financial data.

3. *Analytics & Machine Learning* 🟥

   * Integrate simple machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis, like predicting future expenses based on user history or recommending budget adjustments.

4. *Building a RESTful API with GraphQL* 🟥

   * Instead of a REST API, consider using GraphQL for fetching data. This will teach you about query optimisation, batching, and server-side handling of complex queries.
